Recipes HTML page project (developing HTML and CSS skills)

This is a very simple HTML project issued by The Odin Project as a part of my foundational web dev learning. Webpage will have simple buttons, images, links, paragraphs, etc... all formatted in a readable way in HTML format. Simply for practice. Thanks for reading !
